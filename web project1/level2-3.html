     <p>
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIF you can keep your head when all about you 
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbspAre losing theirs and blaming it on you;</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIF you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, 
   <br>But make allowance for their doubting too;</br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbspbeing lied about, don't deal in lies,</br>
&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbspOr, being hated, don't give way to hating,
  <span>
  <h3>
  <em>
  <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;</br>
  </em>
  </h3>
  </span>

  </div>
<br></br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  <br>&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you can meet with Triumph and Disaster 
  <br>And treat those two impostors just the same;</br>
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken 
  <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</br>
&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbspOr watch the things you gave your life to, broken, 
  <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd stoop and build ‘em up with worn-out tools;</br>
<br></br>
<div>
<strong>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you can make one heap of all your winnings 
  <br>&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings 
  <br>And never breathe a word about your loss;</br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew 
  <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo serve your turn long after they are gone,</br>
&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you 
<span>
<em>
<h3>
  <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspExcept the Will which says to them:</br>
  </h3>
  </em>
  </span>

  </div>
<br></br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  <br>&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbspOr walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;
  <br>If all men count with you, but none too much;</br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute 
  <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith sixty seconds' worth of distance run.</br>
  <div>
  <h3>
<br>&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbspYours is the Earth and everything that's in it,</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son!
