           <div class="h1">
           <em>
           IF you can keep your head when all about you
            <br> &nbsp &nbsp Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;</br>
          IF you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
             <br>&nbsp &nbspBut make allowance for their doubting too;</br>
          If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
            <br>&nbsp &nbspOr, being lied about, don't deal in lies,</br>
          Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,
            <br>&nbsp &nbspAnd yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;</br>
            </em>

          <div class="h2">
          <em>
          If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
            <br>&nbsp &nbspIf you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;</br>
          If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
            <br>&nbsp &nbspAnd treat those two impostors just the same;</br>
          If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
            <br>&nbsp &nbspTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</br>
          Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
            <br>&nbsp &nbspAnd stoop and build ‘em up with worn-out tools;</br>
            </em>
             <br></br>

          <em>
          If you can make one heap of all your winnings
            <br>&nbsp &nbspAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</br>
          And lose, and start again at your beginnings
            <br>&nbsp &nbspAnd never breathe a word about your loss;</br>
          If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
            <br>&nbsp &nbspTo serve your turn long after they are gone,</br>
          And so hold on when there is nothing in you
            <br>&nbsp &nbspExcept the Will which says to them:</br>
            </em>

          If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
            <br>&nbsp &nbspOr walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;</br>
          If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;
            <br>&nbsp &nbspIf all men count with you, but none too much;</br>
          If you can fill the unforgiving minute
            <br>&nbsp &nbspWith sixty seconds' worth of distance run.</br>

          <br>Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,</br>
          &nbsp &nbspAnd—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son!
